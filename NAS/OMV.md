### User setup. 

All GUI created user have group GID=100. 

If manually set premissino on these user, we can restrict them from accessing the wrong data folder.

All persistent data file generated by each docker will be visiable to each other. (since GID=100). 

The end solution is to create user from CLI. `sudo useradd -U jellyfin`
